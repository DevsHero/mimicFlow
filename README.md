## 🤔 Why MimicFlow?

AI “Fast Apply” workflows are powerful—but they often create a trust gap.

- Diffs can be hard to interpret.
- Large edits feel opaque.
- Reviewing becomes reactive instead of observable.

MimicFlow turns code changes into a **cinematic preview sandbox**: you can **watch the code being written** (Ghost Typing) before you commit.

### ✅ Key Benefits

- 🧠 **Trust**: understand what changed by watching it happen.
- 🔍 **Observability**: see the process, not just the outcome.
- 🎓 **Education**: learn patterns from AI-generated edits.
- 🛟 **Safe Sandbox**: preview history without polluting your repo.

## ✨ Key Features (Phase 1)

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Auto-Capture Watcher**: automatically records every file save as a `.ghost` history file.
- ⏳ **Time Machine (Git Mining)**: mines past git commits to generate history for existing projects instantly.
- 🎬 **Cinematic Player**: Monaco-based webview player with a realistic ghost cursor + typing effects.
- 📺 **Seamless Playlist**: plays grouped files sequentially—perfect for reviewing a full feature implementation.
- 🛡️ **Git Isolation**: keeps Source Control clean—history is stored locally in `.mimicflow` (git-ignored).
- 🗂️ **Smart Dashboard**: organize history by Date, Folder, Type, or Commit with a responsive grid.
- 🤝 **Curated Sharing**: private by default—share specific moments to a team folder when needed.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. Install **MimicFlow** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open the MimicFlow sidebar:
	 - Click the MimicFlow icon in the Activity Bar.
	 - Or run: `MimicFlow: Open Dashboard`
3. Save files as you work—MimicFlow auto-captures changes.
4. Browse your history and click a card to play it back.

### Quick workflow

- 🗂️ Open **History** → filter/group → pick a moment
- ▶️ Play a single file or **Play All** for a group playlist
- 🤝 Use **Share** to export selected moments to the team folder

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- 🎥 **Video Export (Pro)**: export sessions as MP4/GIF for tutorials/YouTube.
- 🎙️ **Voiceover Sync**: AI narration synced to code changes.
- 🔌 **Universal Adapters**: JetBrains + Zed support.
